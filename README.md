The source data for this use case is taken from [this](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/deepakjoshi2k/yahoo-stock-prediction-by-news?resource=download) data scource in Kaggle. Alternatively, paid APIs from different sources are available to get a more concise set of daily news articles, events, and quarterly revenue updates which can also be fed as inputs to the prediction model. A number of pre-trained models from HiggingFacee are also available which can be used and probably would give a better predictuon accuracy (reduced MSE and RMSE). Further exploration is possible.
